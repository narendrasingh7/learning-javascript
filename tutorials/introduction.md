HTML, CSS and JavaScript, these three language is main part of web development:

HTML : used to create the layout and structure or skeleton of the website.

CSS 	  : used to create the appearance of website like how a website will look like.

JS  	  : used to add functionality to the website.

**Analogy Example:**

Imagine you're building a car:

* **HTML** forms the body of the car, providing the structure.
* **CSS** acts as the paint job, determining the color, style, and overall appearance.
* **JavaScript** serves as the engine, powering the car and enabling it to move and function.

In web development, HTML creates the structure, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality, much like the components of a car working together to make it run.
